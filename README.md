# Netflix Content Engagement & Viewer Retention: Hooked or Dropped

A Power BI storytelling project that explores **viewer engagement patterns, drop-off risks**, and **strategic content opportunities** across Netflix’s global catalog — based on genre, duration, and country trends.

This project merges **data analysis, visual storytelling, and business impact modeling** into an interactive Power BI dashboard and executive PDF report.

**Goal:**                                                                                                                                                                           

Discover patterns of viewer engagement, drop-offs, inefficiencies, and make powerful recommendations for Netflix - enabling them to make smarter, more audience-aligned content decisions.

---

**💡Project Objectives:**

- Identify which content types and durations lead to early viewer drop-off.
- Reveal high-engagement content zones across genres and countries.
- Measure production vs. engagement mismatch (Success Gap).
- Recommend where Netflix should invest more (or less) to improve retention.
- Present results through an executive-style dashboard & story-driven reporting.
